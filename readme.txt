This is the readme file for my assignment on a personal website.

How to access my website; download all files and open through brackets, load index
page first and then navigate as you wish.

My website is a personal website describing different aspects about me. It has a
homepage (index), an athlete page, an education page, an interests and hobbies page
and finally a gallery.


Styling:

I have kept most of my styling to my external stylesheet labelled "index.css"
There is also a stylesheet for google fonts and for "fonts-awesome" which I used 
to help create the social media buttons found in the footer.

I have used internal styling too for variations from the overall style. These are
uniqe to the page that they are found on.

I have used the inline stlying minimally to adjust styles for individual elements
on a page.

Structure:

Each of my pages has a very similar structure;
-Container; overall container that contains everything.
-Header; within container, contains cover photo for each page.
-Nav; within the container, navigation bar.
-Content; another 'container' within the container. This will be structured differently
from page to page eg. left and right columns or one central column.
-Footer; within the container; composed of left and right foot divs.

Requirements:

Links to both your own pages and external webpages -- nav bar links and social media
buttons in the footer.
A navigation bar -- Located on all pages
At least one table -- Seasonly Progression table found on "Athlete" page
At least one list (ordered or unordered) -- Unordered list found on "Athlete" page
At least one local or embedded video -- Local videos on Athlete page
At least four CSS3 and four HTML5 elements -- CSS3 and HTML5 used thoughout the website
Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. position, float) -- Column divs make
use of float property. Nav bar uses position sticky.
Make use of both inline and block elements -- Inline elements, images throughout website
and links <a> in nav bar and footer. Block elements; multiple headings <h1> <h2> etc
<ul> <div> <p> <table> all used.

Additional Features of HTML and CSS:

I have given my website a responsive design. To do this I have put most images divs and
videos to a given % for width and height auto to allow adjustments for different screen sizes.
Similarly the footer and nav bar are responsive in size. I have given all text a relative
font-size to the viewport width, using vw versus px.

I have also used z-index for my nav bar and I use the clear property throughout.

I make use of columns to structure each page.


Material Sources:

Most of my stlying and structuring of the website has been based on the W3Cs HTML and CSS
tutorials.


HTML Checker:

No errors or warnings on any HTML sheets except the "Athlete" sheet. Error found was 
width: % , height: auto -- Expected pixels -- However I have kept it as % and auto
to keep my page responsive.
